Creating software is like engineering: if a crucial part breaks, everything fails. How can we prevent such a disaster? Of course, we can test our programs, but is it sufficient? A program that passes all the tests might still have other problems:

It can have a bad design, so no one uses it
We cannot extend any part of it and add new features, because it's hard to understand how it works
In this topic, we will talk only about the inner design of the applications and what helps us to improve and evolve it over time.

Program design
All programs manipulate data, and although all the programs are different, let's think of them as pipelines with data: a program receives some input, processes it, and produces some output. A program can be like a maze:



The data comes from one function to another, and so on, and in the end, we get the result. It seems like we can control the data, but if there is an obstacle in our way, we are facing a complex problem. Moving only by straight paths doesn't save us from the growing complexity.

However, a program can have a different structure:



We keep the diversity of data paths but organize the code the other way. We can say that we have another design for the program. The design of a program is the way to organize the code structure to achieve its primary goals.

Making a good design from scratch is not that simple, and we often don't know all its requirements in the very beginning. What we surely can do is follow guidelines or principles to make the design more effective and clear.

If you're working with a code base of about several hundreds of lines of code, you can start with any design you like. Poor design decisions would hardly be such a huge problem for you.
Design principles
As we already know, applications have a design, but what can help us to make it better?

Design principles are rules that guide you to better decisions for the design of your program. You can refer to them when you want to add or update any part of the code.

Some of them come almost from common sense:

Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
You Ain't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)
Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)
As you can guess, the DRY principle means, it's better to reuse code instead of copying it from one place to another. YAGNI is the principle of doing only the work that you need and not doing anything else. KISS stands for making the code simpler for better understanding.



Not all principles are easy to learn. Some of them, like GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns) is a whole ecosystem with many design patterns included and mostly adhere to object-oriented programming.

The other principles do not involve any additional knowledge, but it takes time to understand their meaning and significance. Let's look at another five software design principles hiding by the SOLID acronym.

SOLID
There is no one design principle to follow when designing your program. Why? Because as your program grows, it becomes more complex. You will need to familiarize yourself with different approaches to help manage your program through different kinds of complexities. To make the path to our goals smooth, we can rely on SOLID design principles.

Each letter in SOLID refers to a distinct design principle:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
That's a whole world behind this term! Each principle is independent of others, but applying them together works as a synergy for your design.

SOLID principles help you to organize your code in a way that any other developer familiar with these principles can use and extend it. Applying them, you make your code more structured and clean, so it doesn't look like a maze anymore.

Discussing each principle in detail is out of the scope of this topic, all of them deserve a whole independent topic for themselves.
Conclusion
To make a sustainable program that we can easily maintain for months or even years, we should think about its design first. Getting to work on it, we should apply our knowledge of design principles.

We can use our common sense with DRY, YAGNI, or KISS. However, when working on a huge project, it's better to use a more complicated approach based on the set of SOLID principles.
